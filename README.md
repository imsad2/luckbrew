**Luckbrew** is a small game where you brew potions and other stuff that increase luck, then sell them to people who just can't catch a break.

This project is in no affiliated to homebrew, which is unrelated.

 ## Usage
To play Luckbrew simply download the exe and double-click it. Windows'll probably say that it doesn't recognize the program; if that's the case, simply click "Learn more" and then "Run anyway". There's isn't really any installer or anything, but you can create a shortcut on your Desktop if you'd like.

Linux support isn't available yet, but you can download the source code and run the `.py` file with...well, Python. You'll need at least Python 3.9 in my experience for it to work.

## Building
To build Luckbrew simply run `pyinstaller` on main.py, with the command<br>
<code>pyinstaller main.py --onefile</code><br>
Wait for pyinstaller to finish and you're done!
